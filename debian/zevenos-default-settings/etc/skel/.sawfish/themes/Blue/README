This theme brings Microsoft Windows XP's "Watercolor" look
(as seen in screenshots of build 2410) to Sawfish.

It implements the following features and configuration options:

- Different images for maximize and restore buttons.

- Optional window icon in upper left corner of non-transient windows.

- The close, iconify and maximize/restore buttons are removable.

- The iconify and maximize/restore buttons of transient windows
  can be hidden with configuration options.

- Text colors can be customized.

- Optional resize triangle in the lower right corner of a window's
  client area.

- Customizable Y offset for title bar text.

Implemented by Stefan Zeiger <szeiger@szeiger.de>.
Version 0.6 (2001-03-27).

Changes from previous version:

- Rewrote and cleaned up the Lisp code. The new theme.jl file
  is less than half as big as the previous version and should
  be a lot easier to maintain.

- The new version is probably quite a bit faster as well.
