DragDome is a customisable tab-styled window theme based on
tigert's excellent TigDome.  It includes support for 
customisable colours, button placement and draggable 
titlebars (which also requires the title-offset.jl module).

title-offset.jl is available at
<http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/students/jdpeters/>.
This version of DragDome requires at least version 0.2.

TigDome was SmallDome with yet another titlebar by tigert.
Smalldome was Moondome with a smaller titlebar by Ville Pätsi.
Moondome was a hack of the BeOS theme created by Ken Lynch.
